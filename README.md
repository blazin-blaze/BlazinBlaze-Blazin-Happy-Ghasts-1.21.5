### Dried Ghasts

You can find Dried Ghast blocks naturally throughout the Soul Sand Valleys. They'll spawn next to some nether fossils.

You can also craft a Dried Ghast block using **4 ghast tiers, 4 bone blocks, and 1 ghast soul**. A **ghast soul** can be obtained by killing Ghasts.

Ghastlings can be spawned by taking a Dried Ghast block and submerging it in water. Over time, it will become increasingly hydrated, eventually turning into a Ghastling. **Ghastlings will eventually grow into Happy Ghasts, but their growth can be sped up using snowballs.**

## Harnesses

## Happy Ghast Advancements

![Happy Ghast advancements](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/28b440af6abb1cacde41f6c1011207782c9b8a23.png)

There are now 14 new advancements to collect! They range from taking your Happy Ghast to the Nether or the End, freeing a ghast from the Nether, shooting another Ghast with a Happy Ghast's fireball, and much more! If you are skilled enough, you'll be able to get all of them and achieve Happy Royalty!

![Golden snowball](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/66ff63e4eb65302a9cb193ee22c65c63138d94e7.png)

*oh yeah, if you feed your Happy Ghast 10,000 snowballs, you'll get a special item that provides unlimited healing to full health, the Golden Snowball!*

## Happy Ghast Aging

Over time, Happy Ghasts will age. After roughly 2 in-game hours, they will age slightly, and after roughly 4 hours, they will age into an aged Happy Ghast. Take care of your elders! *(this  change is purely aesthetic, though.)*

## Ghast Conversion

If you take a regular Ghast to the overworld, after 2 minutes, it will turn into a Happy Ghast. I'm sure it'll be overjoyed that you decided to save it!

In contrast, taking a Happy Ghast to the Nether will turn it back into a regular Ghast. You monster!
